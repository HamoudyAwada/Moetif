<p>Hey there! My name is Mohamad, better known as Moetif! Moetif has been my passion project for a few years now, although for a long time I wasn't nearly as consistent as I wish I was. I'm happiest when I have some avenue of expression of for my creativity! I love making videos and anything else that completely allows me to use both my creative and analytical sides. Looking forward to a lifetime of creativity and building a community that I get to share that creativity with!</p>
