    </header>
    <p>When coming up with my creative name, I'd like to tell you that it took me ages and that I sat here and thought about it for ages. Because that's exactly what happened! I spent weeks just sitting and brainstroming creative ideas about who I was and how I wanted to brand myself. Finally I landed on my name: <strong>Moetif</strong>. Of course this is a play on the word motif. I want to be able to leave a stamp on my work that lets people know its mine without explicitly stating so. I want to leave my mark on the Earth in my time here!</p>
