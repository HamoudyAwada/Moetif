        <h1>The Name!</h1>
    </header>
    <p>When coming up with my creative name, I'd like to tell you that it took me ages and that I sat here and thought about it for ages. Because that's exactly what happened! I spent weeks just sitting and brainstroming creative ideas about who I was and how I wanted to brand myself. Finally I landed on my name: Moetif. Of course this is a play on the word motif. I want to be able to leave a stamp on my work that lets people know its mine without explicitly stating so. I want to leave my mark on the Earth in my time here!</p>

        <h2>Who I Am!</h2>
    </header>
    <p>My name is Mohamad, although I'm better known as Moetif on the internet! I'm a 19, soon to be 20 year old student who enjoys creating media of all kinds! For as long as I can remeber I've wanted to be able to use my creativity day to day. In 2022 I decided it wa finally time to give myself the opportunity to! </p>

        <h3>Where I'm Going!</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Originally upon starting my channel, I had no clear direction of where I wanted to go. Well, now I know... That I don't wanna know! I think so much is already certain in this world, sometimes we can benefit from a little bit of go with the flow. I don't like to put myself in a box or lock myself down to one specific style, or creative (or physical) space! I hope to continue moving forward into a state of mind and creative workflow that keeps me pushing my boundaries and stayiong uncertain, and maybe inspire others to do the same!</p>
